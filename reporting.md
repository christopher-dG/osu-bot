# Reporting errors

If you notice something wrong in a bot comment, you can make a reply beginning with "!error" to open a GitHub issue (no account required).

For example:

> !error AR9 + DT is 10.3, not 10

If something looks very wrong such as broken Markdown syntax, [tag me](https://reddit.com/u/PM_ME_DOG_PICS_PLS) in your reply.

# Things to NOT report

I've gotten a lot of duplicate reports of stuff that I have no control over, including:

* "It's showing Cookiezi as rank #2, not rank #1" (this is a Bancho bug)
* "The pp calculation is a little bit off" (this is `oppai`'s job, not mine)
* "The acc in the pp section is wrong" (somewhat hard to explain, see [here](https://github.com/ppy/osu-api/issues/155))

Please don't report these.

Thanks for helping to make osu!-bot better!
