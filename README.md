# osu!-map-linker-bot

[/u/map-linker-bot](https://reddit.com/u/map-linker-bot) is a Reddit bot to comment on [/r/osugame](https://reddit.com/r/osugame) score posts with beatmap information.

## To score posters

The bot depends on you to properly format your title! Your post title needs to begin with this:
```
Player Name | Song Artist - Song Title [Diff Name] +Mods
```

Example:

```
Cookiezi | xi - FREEDOM DiVE [FOUR DIMENSIONS] +HDHR 99.83% FC 800pp *NEW PP RECORD*
```

What comes after the player, map, and mods does not matter. The bot won't be able to find the beatmap if there are typos in the player, artist, song, or diff names.
