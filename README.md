**[osu!bot](https://reddit.com/u/osu-bot) is a Reddit bot that posts beatmap and player information to [/r/osugame](https://reddit.com/r/osugame) score posts.**

### Information For Score Posters

The bot depends on you to properly format your title! The beginning of your post title should look something like this:

```
Player Name | Song Artist - Song Title [Diff Name] +Mods
```

For example:

```
Cookiezi | xi - FREEDOM DiVE [FOUR DIMENSIONS] +HDHR 99.83% FC 800pp *NEW PP RECORD*
```

In general, anything following the [official criteria](https://redd.it/7gzfhp) should work.

### Contact

Messages to the bot are forwarded to me, so feel free to [PM](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=osu-bot&subject=Feedback) any problems, questions, or suggestions, or just reply to one of its comments.
