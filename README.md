# OsuBot

[/u/osu-bot](https://reddit.com/u/osu-bot) is a Reddit bot that posts beatmap
and player information to [/r/osugame](https://reddit.com/r/osugame) score posts.

### To Score Posters

The bot depends on you to properly format your title!
The beginning of your post title should look something like this:

```
Player Name | Song Artist - Song Title [Diff Name] +Mods
```

For example:

```
Cookiezi | xi - FREEDOM DiVE [FOUR DIMENSIONS] +HDHR 99.83% FC 800pp *NEW PP RECORD*
```

There are plenty of other subtleties to title formatting that will/won't work,
but in general just do what everyone else does and there shouldn't be any
problems.

### Development Dependencies

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
* [`oppai`](https://github.com/Francesco149/oppai-ng) binary somewhere on your
  `$PATH`
